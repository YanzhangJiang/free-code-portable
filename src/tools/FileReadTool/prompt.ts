Use the path supplied by the user when reading that file. If the file does not exist or access is denied, the tool returns an error.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to ${MAX_LINES_TO_READ} lines starting from the beginning of the file${maxSizeInstruction}

- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.
- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the ${BASH_TOOL_NAME} tool.
- If the current model supports image input and the user provides a screenshot path, use this tool to view that file. File access remains subject to the session's permissions.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.`
